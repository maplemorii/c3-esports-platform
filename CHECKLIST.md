---

## PHASE 8 — FUTURE FEATURES

- [ ] Live match score ticker (WebSocket / Server-Sent Events)
- [ ] Discord bot integration (post results to server)
- [ ] Player stats aggregation across seasons
- [ ] Public API (read-only) for community tools

---

## PHASE 9 — MATCH SCHEDULING

> Staff needs a way to bulk-create or auto-generate the full round-robin schedule for a division. Right now matches must be created one by one.

### Schema
- [ ] No schema changes needed — `Match` model is sufficient

### API
- [ ] `POST /api/admin/seasons/[seasonId]/divisions/[divisionId]/schedule/generate`
  - Reads all APPROVED team registrations for the division
  - Generates a round-robin fixture list (every team plays every other team once, or twice if configured)
  - Creates `Match` rows with `status=SCHEDULED`, assigns `weekId` by distributing matchups across existing `LeagueWeek` rows
  - Returns count of matches created; idempotent (skip if match between same pair already exists in the season)
- [ ] `DELETE /api/admin/seasons/[seasonId]/divisions/[divisionId]/schedule` — wipe generated schedule (only SCHEDULED matches, not completed ones)

### Admin UI
- [ ] Add "Generate Schedule" button to `/admin/seasons/[seasonId]` division section
  - Shows team count + projected match count before confirming
  - Calls the generate endpoint, refreshes page on success
- [ ] Add "Clear Schedule" danger button (only visible when all matches are SCHEDULED)

---

## PHASE 10 — EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS

> The Resend infrastructure and email helpers exist. Nothing triggers notifications for the key lifecycle events.

### Emails to implement
- [ ] **Registration reviewed** — send to team owner when registration is approved, rejected, or waitlisted
  - Trigger: `PATCH /api/seasons/:seasonId/registrations/:regId` on status change
  - Content: season name, division, status, staff notes if rejected
- [ ] **Match scheduled** — send to both team owners when a match is created
  - Trigger: `POST /api/matches` (and schedule generate endpoint above)
  - Content: opponent name, scheduled date/time, check-in window, match detail link
- [ ] **Result submitted against your team** — send to opposing team owner when scores are submitted
  - Trigger: `POST /api/matches/:matchId/result`
  - Content: submitted scores, link to confirm or dispute
- [ ] **Match disputed** — send to both team owners + staff when a dispute is filed
  - Trigger: `POST /api/disputes`
- [ ] **Dispute resolved** — send to both team owners when staff resolves a dispute
  - Trigger: `PATCH /api/disputes/:disputeId`

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Create `src/lib/email/notifications.ts` exporting one function per notification type
- [ ] Each function: fetch relevant data (match, teams, users), call Resend send, fire-and-forget (`.catch(() => undefined)`)
- [ ] Respect `user.emailNotifications` preference field (skip send if false)
- [ ] Add email template files under `src/lib/email/templates/` (plain HTML or React Email components)

---

## PHASE 11 — ROSTER LOCK

> Prevent teams from adding or removing players after a configured date per season to stop mid-season roster manipulation.

### Schema
- [ ] Add `rosterLockAt DateTime?` field to `Season` model
- [ ] Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_season_roster_lock`

### API enforcement
- [ ] In `POST /api/teams/:teamId/roster` — check if the team has an APPROVED registration for the active season and `season.rosterLockAt < now()`; return 403 if locked
- [ ] In `DELETE /api/teams/:teamId/roster/:entryId` — same check
- [ ] STAFF+ bypass: skip the lock check if requester has STAFF role

### Admin UI
- [ ] Add "Roster Lock Date" datetime field to the season create and settings forms (`/admin/seasons/create`, `/admin/seasons/[seasonId]/settings`)
- [ ] Show roster lock status on the admin season detail page
- [ ] Show a "Roster is locked" notice on the team roster page (`/(dashboard)/team/[teamId]/roster`) when lock is active

---

## PHASE 12 — PUBLIC TEAM INVITE LINKS

> Team managers generate a shareable link. Anyone who opens it and is signed in gets added to the team's pending roster queue instead of requiring staff to search by email.

### Schema
- [ ] Add `inviteToken String? @unique` and `inviteExpiresAt DateTime?` to `Team` model
- [ ] Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_team_invite_token`

### API
- [ ] `POST /api/teams/:teamId/invite` — generate a new random token (32-byte hex), set `inviteExpiresAt = now + 7 days`; TEAM_MANAGER+ only
- [ ] `DELETE /api/teams/:teamId/invite` — revoke the current token (set both fields null)
- [ ] `POST /api/invite/[token]` — public endpoint; requester must be authenticated + have a player profile; adds them to the roster (same logic as `/api/teams/:teamId/roster` POST); returns 410 if token expired

### UI
- [ ] Add "Invite Link" panel to `/dashboard/team/[teamId]/roster`
  - Shows current link with copy button
  - "Generate New Link" / "Revoke" buttons
  - Shows expiry date
- [ ] Create `/invite/[token]` page — shows team name + logo, "Join Team" button; redirects to dashboard on success; shows error if token invalid/expired

---

## PHASE 13 — SEASON ARCHIVE

> After a season ends, display a dedicated summary page: final champion, standings snapshot, top stats, all results.

### Schema
- [ ] Add `archivedAt DateTime?` to `Season` model (set when status → COMPLETED)
- [ ] Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_season_archived_at`

### API
- [ ] `GET /api/seasons/:seasonId/archive` — returns final standings snapshot, champion per division, top goal scorers from `ReplayPlayerStat`, total matches played
- [ ] `PATCH /api/seasons/:seasonId` already handles status → COMPLETED; add side effect to set `archivedAt = now()`

### Public UI
- [ ] Create `/(public)/seasons/[seasonSlug]/archive` page
  - Header: season name, dates, "Season Complete" badge
  - Per division: champion team card (logo, name, record), final standings table
  - Top stats strip: most goals, most saves, most MVPs (from replay stats)
  - Full results: collapsible list of all completed matches
- [ ] On the season overview page (`/(public)/seasons/[seasonSlug]`), show "View Season Archive →" banner when `archivedAt` is set
- [ ] Link to archive from the public seasons list for completed seasons
